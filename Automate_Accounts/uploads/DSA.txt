# 🔵 **1. Array & String (Most Common Category)**

### ⭐ Must Solve

1. **Two Sum Problem**
2. **Find Missing Number in Array**
3. **Find Duplicate in Array**
4. **Move All Zeros to End**
5. **Kadane’s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)**
6. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**
7. **Rotate Array (Left or Right)**
8. **Product of Array Except Self**
9. **Longest Common Prefix**
10. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window)**

### Why it is asked:

Data pipelines often process large arrays/batches → they want optimization mindset.

# 🔵 **2. HashMap / Dictionary Based Questions**

1. **Count Frequency of Elements**
2. **First Non-Repeating Character**
3. **Group Anagrams**
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(words):
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)
    
    for word in words:
        # Step 1: Sort the word and use it as a key
        key = ''.join(sorted(word))
        
        # Step 2: Append the original word to the list of its key
        anagrams[key].append(word)
    
    # Step 3: Return the grouped anagrams
    return list(anagrams.values())

words = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(groupAnagrams(words))

4. **Top K Frequent Elements**
5. **Find Pair With Given Sum Using Hashing**

### Why it is asked:

Hash maps are heavily used in ETL, aggregations, deduplication logic, joins.

# 🔵 **3. Linked List Basics**

(Data Engineer roles don’t go deep)

1. **Reverse Linked List**
2. **Detect Cycle in Linked List** (Floyd’s algorithm)
3. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**

---

# 🔵 **4. Tree / Binary Tree Questions**

(Asked occasionally)

1. **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**
2. **Height of Binary Tree**
3. **Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Traversal**
4. **Check if Tree is Balanced**

### Why:

To test recursion, BFS, DFS thinking.

---

# 🔵 **5. Sliding Window Questions**

Very common now.

1. **Longest Subarray with Sum K**
2. **Max Sum Subarray of Size K**
3. **Longest substring with K distinct characters**

### Why:

Similar to processing “windowed aggregations” in streaming pipelines (e.g., Spark).

---

# 🔵 **6. Stack / Queue**

Small easy questions:

1. **Valid Parentheses**
2. **Next Greater Element**
3. **Min Stack**
4. **Queue using Two Stacks**

---

# 🔵 **7. Matrix / 2D Array**

Important for Data Engineers (CSV/Tabular processing)

1. **Search in 2D Sorted Matrix**
2. **Rotate Matrix (90 degrees)**
3. **Spiral Order Traversal**

---

# 🔵 **8. SQL-style Logic but in Code**

These are *super popular* in Data Engineer rounds:

1. **Find the majority element** (like GROUP BY + LIMIT)
2. **Merge intervals**
3. **Find missing ranges**
4. **Remove duplicates from sorted array**
5. **Find median of two sorted arrays (simplified version)**

---

# 🔵 **9. Frequency + Sorting Problems**

Used to test analytical/ETL mindset.

1. **Sort Characters By Frequency**
2. **Sort Array of 0s, 1s, 2s (Dutch National Flag)**
